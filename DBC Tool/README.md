# DBC Tool - Folder Contents

- **DBC Tool-Source-Code.py**: Main Python application for the DNA-Based Computing (DBC) tool. Run this file to launch the interface.
- **requirements.txt**: List of required Python packages. Install with `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
- **icon-png.ico**: Custom icon used for the application windows.
- **Example Data.txt**: Example input data file to test and demonstrate the tool. If you want to load your own data, you must follow the same file structure: the top lines are for metadata (such as data type, condition, and dataset ID), followed by lines of numeric data. The application requires this structure to load data files correctly.

This repository supports ongoing research on DNA-Based Computing (DBC) for smart manufacturing.
